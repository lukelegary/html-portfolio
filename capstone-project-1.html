    <h2 style="font-style: italic;">General Information</h2>
        <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Another Competences</h3>
          <p>I have knowledge and 'tact' in relation to people and interpersonal and social situations in general, and attention to processes and their possible improvements with amore holistic view.
            Theoretical and practical (non-specialist) understanding of what virtues are necessary for a successful life and career success.</p>
          <p>I learned how to communicate with people in general; management of an establishment (agency); achieving goals and going beyond expectations;
            sales of products and services; customer relations and problems; problem solving and process optimization.</p>
        <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Hobbies</h3>
          <p>Read classical litererature and study Greek philosophy; watch documentaries, mostly about geopolitics; listen to classical music.</p>
        <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Additional Information</h3>
          I  am  mainly  interested  in  the  areas  of  human  psychology,  philosophy,  economics  and  geopolitics.  
          I  tend  to  be  a  very  observant  person,  who  thinks  and  asks  before  giving  my  opinion  on  something  more  complex,  as  we  don't  know  what  total  consequences  may  occur.  
          I  am  very  motivated  by  the  sense  of  what  the  work  brings  to  me  and  to  those  who  benefit,  having  a  feeling  of  duty  fulfilled  and  contributing  to  the  world  when  doing  it.  
          I  tend  to  be  arrogant  at  several  points,  taking  too  many  points  that  I  believe  are  the  best  ideas,  but  I'm  trying  to  figure  out  the  best  way,  and  I'm  not  ashamed  to  admit  my  mistake.  
          I  may  appear  to  be  unfriendly  and  introverted,  focusing  on  my  activity,  but  I  work  to  be  more  conscious  about  my  behavior.  I  care  a  lot  about  how  my  colleagues  are  doing  their  jobs,  helping  them  if  necessary,  
          and  how  to  improve  their  work  in  general,  when  unnecessary  obstacles  exist  and  how  they  can  be  eliminated  or  alleviated.
